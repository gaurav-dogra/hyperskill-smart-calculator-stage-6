The Problem Statement

The assignment statement may look like the following:

n = 3
m=4
a  =   5
b = a
v=   7
n =9

A variable can have a name consisting of more than one letter.

count = 10

To print the value of a variable you should just type its name.

N = 5
N
5

It should be possible to set a new value to an existing variable.

a = 1
a = 2
a = 3
a
3

If an identifier or value of a variable is invalid, the program must print a message like the one below.

a1 = 8
Invalid identifier
n = a2a
Invalid assignment
a = 7 = 8
Invalid assignment

If a variable is not declared yet, the program should print "Unknown variable".

a = 8
b = c
Unknown variable
e
Unknown variable

Handle as many incorrect inputs as possible. The program must never throw the NumberFormatException or any other exception.

It is important to note, all variables must store their values between calculations of different expressions.
Input/Output example

a  =  3
b= 4
c =5
a + b - c
2
b - c + 4 - a
0
a = 800
a + b + c
809
BIG = 9000
BIG
9000
big
Unknown variable
/exit
Bye!

The program should not stop until the user enters the /exit command.
